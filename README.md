<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a final project for the data mining course. Using pre-trained models and **transfer learning**, the aim is to classify the five classes of grapevine leaves. 
The pretrained models are **MobileNetV2**, **ResNet50**, **EfficientNetB3**, and **InceptionNetV3**.
We see the effects of **autoencoders** on the accuracy and use **10 fold cross validation** as a measurement. 

You can access the comprehensive report and the google colab notebook.
